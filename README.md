# flowsa

flowsa attributes resource use, waste, emissions, and loss to economic sectors. It produces standard tabular formats with
sector attribution data using pandas dataframes.

## Terms

_flows_: represent the physical movement of material or energy as input or output to or between activities.
In LCA terms these are more strictly elementary flows or waste flows, although these LCA uses will not limit the scope of FLOWSA models.

_sectors_: generally these are economic sectors generating economic activity, but are extended
here to include households and institutional end users. Using the BEA definitions in input-output
tables, these can be either _industries_ or _commodities_.

_attribution_: The sectors through which activity uses, produces or receives the flows (input or output).
